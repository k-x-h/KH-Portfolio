# [Project 1: Final Grade Prediction (Machine Learning)](https://github.com/k-x-h/FinalGradePrediction)
+ This project aims to predict the final grade of a student based on a ["Student Performance Data Set"](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Student+Performance) from the [University of California, Irvine (UCI) Center for Machine Learning and Intelligent Systems](https://cml.ics.uci.edu/), using exploratory data analysis, in additional to comparing multiple linear models to see which is best fit.
+ Project is written in Python and uses Pandas, Numpy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Scikit-Learn, and tests models such as Linear, Decision Tree, and K-Nearest Neighbors regression models

# [Project 2: Sentiment Analysis (Natural Language Processing)](https://github.com/k-x-h/Sentiment-Analysis)
+ Conducts a positive/negative and subjective/objective sentiment analysis on the most recent tweets containing a term specified by the user.
+ Project is written in Python and uses Pandas, Tweepy (For tweet scraping), and TextBlob (For sentiment analysis)
+ Defaults to pulling the 50 most recent tweets, but can be modified to go above (Provided that you stay within the Twitter API request limit)

Use of this project requires the user to have their own Twitter Dev API information (Consumer token/secret, access token/secret), but sample results have also been included (New_YorkSentimentAnalysis.csv)

# [Project 3: SAT Scores (Data Cleaning)](https://github.com/k-x-h/dataClean)
+ Conducts data cleaning on a messy dataset of SAT results from 460 New York City schools.
+ Project is written in Python and uses Pandas to normalize and clean text.
